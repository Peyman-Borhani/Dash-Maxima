### `A word from the author`

> Is been few times I found my codes in other repo or commercial site/apps (someone who suppose to hire...) without permission (or honorable mention/crediting), while I'm making less than a minimum base income, including the repos low publicity (stars, follow) plus AIs that learns from our data.
Therefore I decided to don't make most of my codes/repos public, just few demos or partial code updates as dev showcase.  
Then I will gradually do more updates(pushes) per increased public interest or personal motivation based on follows, stars, requests, contributions...  
At least it takes some stars and publicity to care/dedicate to a repo.  
Or once reached some stable success I will open source all, plus some intersting private codes/libs never published before.  
> Until then most of my repos are for code sharing and educational purpose.  *takes some challenge to make it work ;-)*  

For latest updates and commercial usage request a license, or a whole custom app suitable to your business. +far more: improved, secure + support a hard working dev...  

> If this was useful, please do support, credit/knowledgement, contribute, or at least follow/engage on X, Linkedin or here as incentive for further open source development.  
`Thanks.`

## That's it, the rest is Svelte's starter guide...  

```bash
# in case using node and no pnpm yet:  
corepack install -g pnpm
# create a new project in the current directory
pnpm dlx sv
# or using Bun:
bun x sv
#choose whatever you need + package manager you prefer
#then install or update if it isn't already:
pnpm i 
# or
bun i
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
