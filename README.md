## Creating a project

Download the repo, do the settings and `pnpm install`
That's it, the rest is Svelte.dev guide...

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
pnpm create svelte@latest
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
